<p>Payment Terms
Users who availed of the basic subscription are free to access our services but with certain limitations, however, you may choose to upgrade to our premium subscription for additional services.
Subscription Services Payment Options and Methods Basic Maximum of 10 Communities Maximum of 8 joined users per created room Free
Premium Maximum of 25 communities Maximum of 15 joined users per created room Debit or Credit Card Individual Subscription - ₱135 monthly or ₱1620 annually. Organizational Subscription - ₱1464 annually. 
Organizational subscriptions can only be availed by institutions specifically academic institutions who wish to subscribe their students to our application. Meanwhile, an individual subscription can be availed by anyone not belonging to an institution. The price of the subscriptions was determined based on the required payments for the operation of our application and the salaries of the members, while taking into account our expected monthly users. Payments for operation include payment for the domain, transfer fee, virtual private server, and maintenance. For the total breakdown, the domain will cost 1,680 pesos per year, while the transfer fee will be a one time payment that costs 2,800 pesos. The virtual private server will costs 7,500 pesos per month and the maintenance fee will cost 5,500 pesos per month. For the salaries, it will be 25,000 pesos per member every month. The company targets that there will be around 1,000 monthly users in the application so we divided our total monthly expenses, which is 113,000, to the amount of targeted users per month. The initial price of subscriptions was 113 pesos per month, however, to help increase our revenue we added 20 percent of 113 to the initial price. This gives us 135 pesos per month or 1,620 pesos annually for the final price of the premium individual subscription. For the organizational subscriptions, only annual payments are acceted and because we expect organizations to order in bulk, organiational subscriptions cost 10 percent less than individual subscriptions. The total cost of organization subscriptions is 1,464 pesos annually for every user they want to include in the subscription. For our revenue, 4,480 pesos will be put aside in the first month of the first year of operations to handle the costs of the domain and the transfer fee, while 1,680 pesos will be put aside for the domain fee in any subsequent years after that. For the remaining revenue, 20 percent will be allocated to marketing and social media engagement of the application, 20 percent will be allocated to research and development of the application, 40 percent will be allocated to making improvements in the company’s infrastructure, and the remaining 20 percent will be spread out evenly among the four members.
